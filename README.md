# Hi, I'm Ivan üëãüèª

![programmer](img/programmer.gif)

My passion for technology and innovation led me to pursue a degree in **Applied Computer Science** at the [Hamburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/). Here, I get to learn from experienced professors and work on cutting-edge projects that challenge me to apply my skills and creativity. I love being part of this dynamic and diverse community of learners and thinkers!

### Programming Languages

I have learned different programming languages like **Java**, **Kotlin**, **C**, **Erlang**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **Assembly (Thumb-2)**. I enjoy exploring different paradigms and syntaxes, and I think each language has its own strengths and weaknesses. I also like to challenge myself with different problems and projects using these languages.

### Android Development

One of the areas that I have focused on is Android development. I have built several Android apps using **Kotlin** and **Java**, following the best practices and guidelines taught by [Google Developers](https://developer.android.com/). I have gained some basic knowledge of Android development, such as how to work with different types of components and how to communicate between them. I have also explored some popular libraries and frameworks that make Android development easier and faster, such as Firebase, Retrofit, Dagger, and especially [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), which is a modern way of creating beautiful UIs with Kotlin.

### Web Development

Another area that I have learned is web development. I have used [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) to get a blast learning the basics of **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**. These are the building blocks of web development and they allow me to create amazing websites that are dynamic and interactive. I also got to explore some awesome frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), jQuery, React and more. They make web development easier and faster.

### Data Science

I have also learned some data science skills using **Python**. I have used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc. to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. I have also learned some machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as linear regression, logistic regression, k-means clustering, etc.

### Data Bases

I have also learned how to use data bases with **SQL**. I have used **DataGrip** to create and manage data bases using **PostgreSQL** and **Oracle DB**. I am so excited to share that I have learned how to write queries, functions, triggers, and other tools to manipulate data. I can now create, update, delete, and retrieve data from different sources and formats. I have also learned how to build a reliable database that ensures data integrity, security, and performance. This is a great skill that will help me in many projects and tasks.

### Version Control

I have also learned how to use **git** with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) to store my progress and collaborate with others. I have learned how to create branches, commits, pull requests, merge conflicts, etc. I have also used GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD to automate testing and deployment.

### IDEs and Code Editors

I'm also used to modern IDEs and code editors such as **IntelliJ IDEA**, **WebStorm**, **DataGrip**, **VS Code**, etc. I think they are very helpful tools that make programming easier and more enjoyable. I like their features such as code completion, debugging, refactoring, testing, etc.

### Future Plans

I'm always eager to learn something new and improve my skills. Right now, I'm interested in **web and enterprise development**. I want to learn more about **Java Spring** and how to create scalable and secure applications using this framework. I also want to learn more about cloud computing and how to use platforms such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

## Soft Skills ü§ù

One of my strongest soft skills is **communication**. My native language is **Russian**. I can also fluently speak **German** and **English** which I learned by some of the best language schools in Hamburg. This means I can communicate with people from different cultures and backgrounds, and express myself clearly and confidently in any situation. I also have excellent writing and presentation skills that help me convey my ideas effectively.

Another soft skill that I have is **teamwork**. I enjoy working with others and collaborating on projects. I can listen to different opinions and perspectives, and respect everyone's contributions. I can also give and receive constructive feedback, and support my teammates when they need help. I believe that **teamwork is the key to success in any field**.

A third soft skill that I have is **problem-solving**. I love challenges and finding solutions to them. I can **analyze** complex situations and break them down into manageable steps. I can also use my creativity and critical thinking skills to come up with **innovative and effective solutions**. I am always eager to learn new things and improve my skills.
